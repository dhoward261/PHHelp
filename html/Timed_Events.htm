    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Timed Events are simply actions that are solely based
      on the system clock.&nbsp; Timed Events are declared in the Timed Events
      section of the PowerHome Explorer.&nbsp; Timed Events can also be created
      from within macros and formulas.&nbsp; When a timed event is executed, its
      action is either a Macro, Send Keys, Raw Formula, or a Device Control
      string.&nbsp; Timed Events are based upon a timestamp (specific time and
      date) and can have either a recurring frequency (executes and
      automatically creates a copy of itself a specified interval in the future)
      or be a one shot (executes one time and then is destroyed).</div>
