      This screen allows you to add or modify your Insteon Devices. You may
      manually enter Insteon Devices using this screen or use the Auto Discovery
      option on the Setup tab. If you manually enter devices, PowerHome will
      attempt to properly add the Insteon addresses to the PLC internal
      database. However, if you experience problems seemingly related to
      communication or signals not getting through, it may be missing addresses
      in the PLC database. In this situation, it is best to go to the Setup tab
      and first "Clear" PLC Database followed by "Add Min" Insteon ID's to PLC.</div>
