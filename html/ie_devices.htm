<p>This screen allows you to add or modify your Insteon Devices.  You may manually enter Insteon Devices using this screen or use the Auto Discovery option on the Setup tab.  If you manually enter devices, PowerHome will attempt to properly add the Insteon addresses to the PLC internal database.  However, if you experience problems seemingly related to communication or signals not getting through, it may be missing addresses in the PLC database.  In this situation, it is best to go to the Setup tab and first "Clear" PLC Database followed by "Add Min" Insteon ID's to PLC.</p>
