    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Global Variable Max Substitutions</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This field determines the maximum global variable
      substitutions that can occur before an error occurs.&nbsp; This is mainly
      to prevent an infinite loop situation from occurring.&nbsp; When a global
      variable is used within a formula or other situations, its actual value is
      looked up and substituted for the global variable.&nbsp; Since a global
      variable can contain other global variables that can also contain global
      variables, this value places a limit on the maximum number of
      substitutions.&nbsp; An infinite loop situation would occur if global
      variable {ABC} contained an actual value of {XYZ} which is another global
      variable.&nbsp; If global variable {XYZ} contains {ABC}, then the
      substitution algorithm would continue forever and the PowerHome program
      would be hung.&nbsp; The default value for this field is 25. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Maximum Number of Recursive Calls</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This field is similar to the Maximum Global Variable
      Substitutions field in that its purpose is to prevent infinite loop
      situations.&nbsp; This value comes into effect when a macro calls another
      macro that calls another macro, ad infinitum.&nbsp; If a situation where
      macro A calls macro B which calls macro C which calls macro A were to
      occur, this value would prevent the PowerHome program from hanging within
      an infinite loop.&nbsp; The default value for this field is 25.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Macro Jump Limit</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This field will allow you to limit the number of
      times a macro may transfer control to another line within the same
      macro.&nbsp; Useful in preventing infinite loop situations but could also
      limit a legitimate macro from looping properly if set to low.&nbsp; Set
      this value to 0 to disable this feature.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Use Proxy Server in ph_geturl function</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Specifies whether the ph_geturl function should use
      the proxy server values defined under Proxy screen. </div>
