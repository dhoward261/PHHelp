      PowerHome includes a UDP Broadcast server that will send UDP Ethernet
      packets to an internal network whenever certain activities occur within
      the PowerHome program. This server is used by the PowerHome Remote Clients
      as well as by other third party programs to monitor PowerHome internal
      activities and is a powerful means for communicating with other machines
      and applications running on your internal network. The UDP broadcast
      server runs in a separate thread from the main PowerHome program thereby
      offloading the broadcast activity so that PowerHome is not burdened with
      this activity.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome sends four different types of broadcast
      messages with each message type being sent on a different port and to a
      different IP address.You can optionally set the values on this screen so
      that all four messges are sent to the same port if so desired. Usually the
      default values are sufficient for this screen (most third party software
      is designed with these defaults in mind) but you may set the values
      however you like.</div>
