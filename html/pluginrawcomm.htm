    <div class="indent2 padtop1"><STRONG>Launch Data (ActiveX

          PH_Comm.phcomm</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"><STRONG>Initialization Data:</STRONG>  The COM port, a space, the comma
      separated settings string. Can be left blank to establish a connection
      manually. In all cases where a "settings" string is required, it consists
      of the BPS, the data bits, the parity, and the stop bits all separated by
      commas. An example of 9600 BPS, 8 data bits, No parity, and 1 stop bit
      would be: 9600,N,8,1 </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">This plugin provides raw COM port 
functionality for PowerHome. If a COM port and settings string is supplied in 
the Init Data parameter then the connection will be established when the plugin 
is loaded. Several commands are available using the ph_picmd function. Command 1 
will send the string in data3 out the COM if a connection is already 
established. This string can contain binary characters by escaping them with the 
"\" character followed by 3 digits for a decimal representation of the ASCII 
code or followed by an "x" and 2 digits for a hexadecimal representation of the 
ASCII code. Command 2 will send a single character represented by the ASCII 
value contained in the data1 parameter (assuming the COM is connected). Command 
3 will manually connect to the COM port in data1 using the settings supplied in 
data3 (you must be disconnected first). Command 4 disconnect the COM port if 
already connected. Command 5 will return the current connection status (0 =
                 
                  
                
                 
                  
                
                  
                  
                 
                
                  
                 
                 
           connected, 1 = disconnected). Command 6
      will return the COM port. Command 7 will return the settings.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">This plugin will also fire a generic plugin trigger
      whenever data is received on a connected COM port. The trigger fired will
      be command 1, option 1 with the length of the data, the string data with
      binary characters escaped, and the string data with ALL characters escaped
      available in the [TEMP] variables.</div>
