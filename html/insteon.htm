<P>PowerHome provides full support for SmartHome's Insteon protocol and devices 
including software linking. Please read through the Insteon section of the Help 
file in order to maximize your results when using Insteon with PowerHome.</P>
<P>PowerHome utilizes the SmartHome Device Manager ActiveX control for Insteon 
PLC support. This control allows both the serial and USB versions of the Insteon 
PLC to be used and later the ethernet interface when made available.&nbsp; 
PowerHome also supports the newer PLM controller which doesnt require the use of 
the SDM.</P>
