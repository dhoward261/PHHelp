    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome provides full support for SmartHome's Insteon
      protocol and devices including software linking. Please read through the
      Insteon section of the Help file in order to maximize your results when
      using Insteon with PowerHome.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      PowerHome utilizes the SmartHome Device Manager ActiveX control for
      Insteon PLC support. This control allows both the serial and USB versions
      of the Insteon PLC to be used and later the ethernet interface when made
      available.&nbsp; PowerHome also supports the newer PLM controller which
      doesnt require the use of the SDM.</div>
