    <div class="ph1"> CD </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">The Setup CD section is primarily for defining
      parameters for a CD jukebox and for the programming of playlists.&nbsp;
      Most CD jukeboxes allow a sequence of tracks to be programmed into it that
      it will later playback.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Maximum Songs in a Playlist</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This parameter should be set to the maximum number of
      tracks that your jukebox will support being programmed at a time.&nbsp;
      This is typically around 30. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Maximum Number of Jukebox Slots</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This is the number of slots that your jukebox
      has.&nbsp; In the case of Pioneer, many of their players have an extra
      slot for quick playing of a single CD.&nbsp; You would not include this
      extra slot in the total. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Number of Digits when Programming Discs</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This refers to the minimum number of digits to use
      when programming a playlist into your jukebox.&nbsp; When programming a
      playlist into your jukebox, some manufacturers only require the necessary
      digits for a disc.&nbsp; In this case, set this parameter to 0.&nbsp;
      Other manufacturers may require a minimum of 2 digits.&nbsp; An example
      would be programming disc number 8.&nbsp; Some jukeboxes may require the
      disc to be programmed as 0 then 8.&nbsp; Set the parameter to 2 in this
      case. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Number of Digits when Programming Tracks</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This works the same way as Number of Digits when
      Programming Discs but sets the requirements for tracks instead of discs.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">PlaySlotTrack Macro</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This field allows you to set the ID of the default
      macro that is to be used for telling a CD jukebox to play a particular
      slot and track.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">PlayPlayList Macro</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This field allows you to set the ID of the default
      macro that is to be used for telling a CD jukebox to program a playlist
      into the player. </div>
