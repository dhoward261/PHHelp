</div>
<div class=ph10>Return value</div>
<div class=ph11>

Integer.  Returns a 0 if the macros wait time was successfully extended.  Returns a 1 if the specified macro ID is not waiting.

</div>
<div class=ph12>Usage</div>
<div class=ph13>

Use this function to extend the wait time of a macro that is currently waiting (Initiated by the Macro command "Wait").  If multiple macros with the same ID are waiting, this command will only extend the wait time of the oldest waiting macro.  Extending the wait time of a macro does not effect its status as the oldest waiting macro.   Typically this function would be used in conjunction with the ph_ismacrowaiting function to first check if a macro is waiting and then either waiting or extending the wait of a currently waiting macro so as not to have more than 1 macro of the same ID waiting.
