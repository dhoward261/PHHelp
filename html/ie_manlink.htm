    <div class="ph1"> Insteon Explorer - Manual Linking </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">The Manual Linking tab allows a user to experiment with
      the new commands for automatically linking Insteon devices without
      pressing the "Set" button or using the older "Poke" commands. Only the
      very newest Insteon devices support these commands and the bugs are still
      being worked out. This screen may be useful for creating links between
      new, third party Insteon devices that do not support the "poke" memory
      method of link creation.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      Manual Linking in no way updates the PowerHome database as is done using
      the "Links" tab and currently is in experimental status.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">PLC as Controller Linking</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Pressing the "Launch" button will place the currently connected PowerHome
      PLC into "link" mode as a "Controller" for the currently selected "PLC
      Group Number". The "link" will be complete if you press and hold another
      Insteon device's "set" button or by placing a device that supports it into
      "All-link" mode (see below).</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">PLC as Responder Linking</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Pressing the "Link" button will cause the PLC to be linked as a
      "responder" to any device that is currently in link mode as a
      "Controller".</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">PLC as Controller Un-Linking</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Pressing the "Launch" button will place the currently connected PowerHome
      PLC into "unlink" mode. Once the PLC is in "unlink" mode, placing any
      other Insteon device into "link" mode will cause that device to "unlink"
      from the PLC if it was previously linked.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">PLC as Responder Un-Linking</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Pressing the "Un-Link" button will cause the PLC to "unlink" from a device
      that is currently in "unlink" as a controller mde.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">All-Linking</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Allows you to place a remote device (that supports the new command set)
      into either "link" or "unlink" mode programmatically without having to
      press a device's "set" button. Select the Device ID, the group number, and
      then press either "Link" or "Un-Link" as appropriate.</div>
