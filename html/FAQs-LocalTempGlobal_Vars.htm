  There are a total of&nbsp;120 special system 
variables. 10 of these only have scope within the macro, PSP, or formula from 
which they were called. 
<P></P>
  <p>These system variables are [LOCAL1] through [LOCAL10]. These system variables can be used as temporary variables to store characters or numbers. This will save you from using global variables as temporary storage and incurring the database read and write. </p>
  <p>Another 10 special system variables are [TEMP1] through [TEMP10]. </p>
  <p>These variables serve two purposes...</p>
  <p>The first is that they can be referenced and set from within macros, PSP, or formulas. When a macro or formula calls another macro or formula, any values within these system variables are passed continuously down through subsequent calls. These are not global in the sense that the values are the same for all macros, PSP, and formulas. For example, if a timed event launches a macro called TEST1, this macro may set the [TEMP1] through [TEMP10] variables to certain values. If this TEST1 macro calls another macro called TEST2, then the TEST2 macro will be able to reference the values that the TEST1 macro placed in the [TEMP1] through [TEMP10] system variables. TEST2 can in turn call a Send Keys formula that can also reference the values in the variables. When the original macro TEST1 completes, the values in the [TEMP1] through [TEMP10] variables are lost. </p>
  <p>The second use of these variables is to pass parameters from triggers and voice commands. When certain triggers and / or voice commands are processed, some of the [TEMP1] through [TEMP10] system variables will be prepopulated with relevant information that the resulting macro or Send Keys formula can reference. These pre-populated values will be detailed in their relevant sections. </p>
  <p>The last&nbsp;100 special variables are [GLOBAL1] through [GLOBAL20]. These variables are truly global and can be seen from within any formula or macro. They are not stored in the database however and will be lost when PowerHome is shut down.</p>
