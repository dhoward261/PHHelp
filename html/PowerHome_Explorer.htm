    <div class="ph1">PowerHome Explorer</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">The PowerHome Explorer is where most 
maintenance to the PowerHome system is performed.&nbsp; This single window 
allows you to jump section to section with ease and provides a standard 
interface similar to the Windows Explorer.&nbsp; The PowerHome Explorer can be 
launched from the toolbar or from the menu under Maintenance / PowerHome 
Explorer.&nbsp; The Explorer consists of two panes, a left pane which is a 
hierarchical treeview control that allows for easy navigation to all the 
PowerHome elements and a right pane where actual changes and maintenance is 
performed.</div>
      <div class="indent2 padtop1"><IMG alt=Explorer src="images/explorer.png"></div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      You can set the color scheme for the Explorer in the Explorers Setup -&gt;
      Preferences section.&nbsp; The left hand pane supports single
      left-clicking and single right-clicking.&nbsp; By left-clicking on the
      text of a section, that section's maintenance screen will appear in the
      right hand pane and any children under the section will be expanded and
      visible.&nbsp; By left-clicking on a plus to the left of the section text,
      the section will be expanded showing its children without changing the
      maintenance screen in the right pane.&nbsp; Right-clicking anywhere within
      the left pane will minimize the left pane or restore it to its default
      size if already minimized.&nbsp; The Explorer also has a toolbar
      associated with its functions.&nbsp; Hovering the mouse over any of the
      toolbar buttons will reveal the tool tip associated with the button as
      well as the hotkey to directly fire the action.&nbsp; The far left button
      is the 'Back' button and can be activated by pressing the 'F2' key.&nbsp;
      The Explorer window maintains a history of each maintenance screen
      referenced.&nbsp; As you change from screen to screen, this history is
      built up.&nbsp; Pressing the 'Back' button will step you back through the
      Explorer's history to the previous screens.&nbsp; The next button is the
      'Forward' button and can be activated by pressing the 'F3' key.&nbsp; You
      can only move forward after you have built some history and moved back
      with the 'Back' button.&nbsp; Toggling between the 'Back' and 'Forward'
      buttons will allow you to quickly move between maintenance screens.&nbsp;
      The next button is the 'Up' button and can also be referenced by pressing
      the 'F4' key.&nbsp; The 'Up' button may appear similar to the 'Back'
      button but instead of stepping through history, it will move you from a
      child to its parent.&nbsp; The next button is the 'Refresh' button and can
      also be referenced by pressing the 'F5' key.&nbsp; This key will save any
      changes to the maintenance screen immediately, refresh the left hand pane
      with any updated information, and re-retrieve all rows within the right
      hand pane.&nbsp; The button to the right of the ‘Refresh’ button is the
      ‘Database button and can be referenced by pressing the ‘F7’ key.&nbsp;
      This button will allow you to open a different database other than the
      currently connected one such as the sample database.&nbsp; The next couple
      of buttons are the ‘Undo’ and ‘Redo’ buttons.&nbsp; If you have made
      changes to the right-hand pane of the Explorer and have not yet saved
      those changes to the database, you can undo individual changes by pressing
      the ‘Undo’ button or the ‘Ctrl-Z’ key combination.&nbsp; If you undo more
      changes than you like, you can redo them by pressing the ‘Redo’ button or
      the ‘Ctrl-Y’ key combination.&nbsp; Keep in mind that once changes are
      saved to the database, they cannot be changed using the ‘Undo’ and ‘Redo’
      buttons.&nbsp; The last toolbar button is the ‘Undo All’ button and can be
      also be accessed with the ‘F10’ key.&nbsp; This button will undo ALL the
      changes made since the last database save and cannot be recovered using
      the ‘Redo’ button.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      As you navigate from screen to screen, any changes you make are
      automatically saved.&nbsp; If you exit the Explorer, or PowerHome, any
      changes will also be saved.&nbsp; Pressing the ‘Refresh’ toolbar button or
      the ‘F5’ key will also save any changes you’ve made.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      The right hand pane supports single left-clicking, double left-clicking
      for certain screens/columns, and single right-clicking.&nbsp; This is
      where edits to the database are actually performed.&nbsp; Some windows in
      the right hand pane do not support changes and can only be used for
      navigation.&nbsp; These windows will typically be all gray.&nbsp;
      Left-clicking in the right hand pane will allow you to change rows and
      fields if you click within an editable field.&nbsp; Right-clicking will
      bring up a context sensitive pop-up menu with actions that can be
      performed.&nbsp; For example, if you were in the Macro Header maintenance
      screen and right-clicked the third row down, a pop-up menu would appear
      giving you the option to 'Insert', 'Delete', 'Play', 'Duplicate',
      ‘Export’, ‘Create Button’, ‘Cut’, ‘Copy’, or ‘Paste’.&nbsp; By clicking
      'Insert' you will insert a new blank third row and the original third row
      will now be the fourth row.&nbsp; If you had clicked 'Delete', the third
      row would have been deleted.&nbsp; By clicking 'Play', you could play that
      macro.&nbsp; Clicking 'Duplicate' would have created a new row at the
      bottom of all the rows with a copy of the third row macro including all of
      its children rows (the macro detail).&nbsp; You could then click the ID
      column of this newly created row and type over the highlighted text,
      renaming the macro to whatever you wanted.&nbsp; Clicking ‘Export’ will
      allow you to export the macro header record along with its detail children
      to a file in SQL format.&nbsp; This file could then be modified and/or
      emailed to another user and imported into the database using the PowerHome
      Multi-Editor in SQL mode.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      To add rows into the maintenance screen, you would typically right-click
      and choose 'Insert' from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; When editing a completely
      blank maintenance screen, the first row is automatically created for
      you.&nbsp; When you ‘Insert’ a row, where you click determines where the
      row will be inserted.&nbsp; If you right-click on the fifth row, then the
      row will be inserted as the fifth row moving the original fifth row and
      all others below it down one.&nbsp; If you right-click below all rows,
      then the new row will be the last row.&nbsp; But there is an easier way to
      add rows if you are entering one row after another.&nbsp; As you fill out
      a row and navigate between fields using the 'tab' key, when you fill out
      the last field and then tab, a new row is created automatically for
      you.&nbsp; This only happens when the row you are on is the last row (or
      the only row) and you press the 'tab' key when you are in the last
      field.&nbsp; This allows for rapid data entry especially when writing
      macro details.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      Another feature of the PowerHome Explorer window are the resizeable
      panes.&nbsp; If you hover your mouse in the gray area between the left and
      right panes, you will see that your cursor will change from an arrow to a
      double left and right arrow.&nbsp; When the cursor looks like this, you
      can left click and drag the left pane larger or smaller.&nbsp; When you
      release the mouse the left pane will adjust to the size you selected and
      the right pane will fill any gaps.&nbsp; Both panes include horizontal and
      vertical scroll bars when necessary.&nbsp; The right hand pane also
      includes a split-scroll window.&nbsp; At the botton of the right hand
      pane, just to the left of the horizontal scrollbar's left arrow button is
      a black area.&nbsp; When the mouse is hovered over this area, the cursor
      will change to a double left and right arrow with two vertical lines
      between them.&nbsp; You can click and drag this to the right and you will
      be effectively splitting the right hand pane into two pieces, each with
      its own independent horizontal scrollbar.&nbsp; This is useful when
      working on long maintenance rows where you might be scrolled far to the
      right and can no longer see the ID of the rows you are working on.</div>
