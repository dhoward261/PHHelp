    <div class="indent2 padtop1"><STRONG>Launch Data (ActiveX 
Classname):</STRONG>    PH_Socket.phsocket</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"><STRONG>Initialization Data:</STRONG>  The IP address to connect to, a
      space, the port to connect to. Can also be left blank to connect manually
      after launch</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">This plugin provides raw socket 
connectivity for PowerHome. If an IP and port is supplied in the Init Data, then 
a connection will be established when the plugin is loaded. Otherwise, you can 
initiate a connection manually using the ph_picmd function. This plugin supports 
several commands via the ph_picmd function. Command 1 will cause the plugin to 
send the data in the data3 parameter over the socket if a connection is 
established. Command 2 will establish a connection manually to the IP in the 
data3 parameter and the port in the data1 parameter (you must not be currently 
connected). Command 3 will disconnect the socket if it's currently connected. 
Command 4 will return the status of the current connection (0 =     
               
             
           
             
              
             
              
           
         connected, 1 =      
                   
                
               
                
                   
                
                   
                
                 
               not connected). Command 5
      returns the current remote IP of the socket. Command 6 returns the remote
      port of the socket.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">The plugin will also fire generic plugin triggers. The
      trigger for command 1, option 1 will be fired when data is received on the
      socket. The trigger for command 1, option 2 will be fired when the socket
      establishes a connection. The trigger for command 1, option 3 will be
      fired when the socket disconnects. </div>
