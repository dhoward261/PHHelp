    <div class="indent2 padtop1">This allows you to select whether or not you would like
      to have Text to Speech enabled and the engine you would like to use.&nbsp;
      If you would like TTS enabled, you should try to use the Direct SS engine
      as it is more efficient.&nbsp; Some systems may have problems with this
      engine so if it doesnâ€™t work, you can try the TTS Class engine
      instead.&nbsp; If you have SAPI 5 installed, you may also use the SAPI 5
      selection. </div>
