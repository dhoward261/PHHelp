    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Nearly every entity within PowerHome is identified by
      an element called an ID.&nbsp; The ID will usually be the leftmost column
      in most maintenance screens and is required.&nbsp; ID’s must be unique
      within their particular maintenance screen and must consist of only
      letters, numbers, underscore, and the space character.&nbsp; ID’s will be
      all uppercase and must be 25 characters or less.&nbsp; Within these
      restrictions, ID’s can be anything you want but we recommend ID’s be short
      but descriptive since ID’s will be used throughout the PowerHome
      system.&nbsp; Most entities that require ID’s will also have a Description
      field where you may type in a more verbose description of the entity.</div>
