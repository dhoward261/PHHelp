    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Formulas are where most of your automation power is
      derived.&nbsp; Formulas are used throughout PowerHome and are an essential
      component of macros, triggers, and PSP (PowerHome Server Pages).&nbsp;
      Formulas can return text, numeric, and date/time values.&nbsp; Before a
      formula is evaluated, variable substitution is performed upon it.&nbsp;
      Once variable substitution is complete, the formula is passed to the
      formula evaluator.&nbsp; The results of the formula are then passed
      back.&nbsp; Formulas themselves can contain a number of functions.&nbsp;
      The available Formula Functions are documented within the Formulas
      section.</div>
