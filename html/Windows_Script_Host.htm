    <div class="ph1">Windows Script Host</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> WSH is a comprehensive scripting infrastructure for
      the Windows platform.&nbsp; Script files are saved as ordinary text files
      on your system and can be in any language that you have installed an
      engine for.&nbsp; You can execute any WSH file from within a PowerHome
      formula.&nbsp; PowerHome extends the functionality of WSH with a library
      of functions that allows the script to directly control and retrieve
      information from PowerHome.&nbsp; With WSH, you achieve nearly limitless
      programmability and control of the PowerHome program.&nbsp; WSH
      functionality is automatically installed alongside of PowerHome.</div>
