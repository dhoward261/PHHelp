    <div class="ph1">Getting Started</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Once you have successfully installed PowerHome, the
      first thing you should do is configure the system for your interface
      devices and personal preferences.&nbsp; The first time you launch
      PowerHome you will be asked to enter a registration name.&nbsp; This name
      must be between 5 and 50 characters and will be used to generate your
      registration number.&nbsp; This registration number can be found under the
      menu Help-&gt;About.&nbsp; After the registration name has been entered,
      PowerHome will now be running. </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Most configuration and maintenance is done through a
      single screen called the PowerHome Explorer.&nbsp; Advanced Insteon
      configuration and maintenance must be done using the Insteon Explorer
      (explained further below).&nbsp; You can access the PowerHome Explorer
      screen from the menu Maintenance-&gt;PowerHome Explorer.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> <img alt="Explorer" src="images/explorer.png" height="834"
        width="1146"> </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> This screen functions similar to the Windows
      Explorer.&nbsp; The left pane will show your configurable options in a
      treeview and allows for easy navigation.&nbsp; The right pane displays the
      currently selected option and is where changes will be entered.&nbsp;
      Single-clicking items in the left pane will expand any available sub-items
      as well as bringing up the appropriate maintenance screen in the right
      pane.&nbsp; Right-clicking in the left pane will shrink the treeview and
      maximize your maintenance area in the right pane.&nbsp; Once minimized,
      you can right click again and restore the treeview to its standard
      size.&nbsp; Double-clicking in the left pane will have no effect.&nbsp;
      Single-clicking in the right pane will allow you to change focus between
      individual fields.&nbsp; Right-clicking will bring up a pop-up menu if
      available for the current screen.&nbsp; Double-clicking certain fields in
      the right-hand pane may open up additional configuration windows.&nbsp;
      Depending upon the screen, the rows in the right-hand pane may have
      sub-items.&nbsp; You can change to a sub-item screen by clicking on the
      button to the left of each row.&nbsp; When the PowerHome Explorer window
      is closed, any changes will be automatically saved.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Any changes made to the Setup area of PowerHome
      Explorer will not take effect until PowerHome is restarted or
      reinitialized.&nbsp; You must restart or reinitialize PowerHome if you
      make changes to the Setup area in order for these changes to be
      recognized.</div>
