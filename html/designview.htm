      When you declare buttons for the control center, you can set their
      location, height, width, text color, background color, and a hotkey for
      them.&nbsp; You can do this from within the PowerHome Explorer, but it's
      far easier from within the Control Center Design View.&nbsp; Anytime you
      declare a button or make a change to a button from the PowerHome Explorer,
      those changes will not be visible until you close and reopen the Control
      Center (if windowed.&nbsp; If the Control Center is set in preferences as
      a background you must either restart PowerHome or Reinitialize from the
      file menu).&nbsp; When you declare buttons in the PowerHome Explorer, they
      will all default to the same location and same size.&nbsp; Its difficult
      to design your Control Center layouts from here, so just let everything go
      to default.&nbsp; Once you are done defining buttons, close and reopen the
      Control Center so that the newly defined buttons will appear.&nbsp; Next
      go into Design View by right-clicking on the Control Center whose tab you
      wish to edit and select Open Design View from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; You
      will only get the popup menu if buttons have been defined to appear on the
      tab.&nbsp; An empty tab cannot be designed upon.&nbsp; A new window will
      open with a copy of the Control Center tab displayed within it.&nbsp; The
      Design View window will show you approximate screen resolution bars.&nbsp;
      This design view window also has a toolbar associated with it.&nbsp; There
      are a number of functions on this toolbar allowing you to design your
      button layouts graphically.&nbsp; </div>

      When working within Design View, you can select a button by clicking upon
      it.&nbsp; The button will display as selected by appearing
      depressed.&nbsp; Multiple buttons may be selected so that toolbar
      operations can be performed on all selected buttons.&nbsp; Some toolbar
      items are only available when two or more buttons are selected (the size
      functions) and some toolbar items are only available when three or more
      buttons are selected (the space functions).&nbsp; Whenever a toolbar
      operation is performed, all selected buttons will be deselected.&nbsp; You
      can quickly re-select the buttons by pressing the Reselect toolbar item or
      pressing the F1 key.&nbsp; When buttons are selected, they can also be
      manipulated by pressing the arrow keys to nudge all selected buttons in a
      specific direction.&nbsp; If you press the Shift key along with an arrow
      key, you will adjust the size of all selected buttons.&nbsp; You can also
      right-click on an area in the Design View and relocate all selected
      buttons to where you right-clicked.&nbsp; The buttons will be moved in the
      same layout that they currently are with the first selected button’s upper
      left hand corner moving to the spot that was right clicked and all other
      buttons moving relative to it.</div>
    <div class="indent3"><br>
      After saving any changes and closing the Design View window, close and
      reopen the Control Center (or reinitialize if running in background mode)
      so that the new design changes will be visible.</div>
