    <div class="ph1"> Control Center </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">This screen allows you to set the appearance of the
      internal Control Center window.&nbsp; The internal Control Center can be
      either windowed or background.&nbsp; You can also select if you want the
      tab control to be visible or not and if visible, how the tabs will
      appear.&nbsp; The two settings that may require an explanation are below:</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Click on Mouse Up</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This parameter controls how the Control Center
      responds when clicking on Control Center buttons with the mouse.&nbsp; If
      this parameter is checked, then the action associated with the Control
      Center object will not be added to the execution queue until the mouse
      actually clicks up.&nbsp; When the mouse clicks up, you MUST be on the
      Control Center object whose action you want to perform.&nbsp; If this
      parameter is unchecked, then the action associated with a Control Center
      object is sent to the execution queue immediately down clicking the mouse.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Auto Clear Changes</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">The Control Center has a table called ccbuttonstemp
      that is a mirror of the ccbuttons table (where the Control Center object
      details are stored when editing the Control Center from the PowerHome
      Explorer).&nbsp; When a Control Center screen is rendered, the values are
      read from the ccbuttonstemp table rather than the ccbuttons table.&nbsp;
      Since details of Control Center objects can be dynamically updated via
      PowerHome functions, the updates are done to the ccbuttonstemp table and
      not the ccbuttons table.&nbsp; This parameter controls how often the
      dynamic changes made to the ccbuttonstemp table are discarded (the
      ccbuttons table is copied to the ccbuttonstemp table).</div>
