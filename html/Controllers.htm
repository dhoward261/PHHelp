    <div class="ph1"> Controllers </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome allows for virtually an unlimited number of
      hardware controllers to be defined.&nbsp; Within this section of the
      PowerHome Explorer, you can declare the various hardware interfaces you’ve
      connected to the PowerHome computer.&nbsp; This is where you would declare
      your Insteon, UPB, X10, and IR controllers.&nbsp; Each controller must
      have a unique ID within this section.&nbsp; This screen also has a column
      named “Load Order”.&nbsp; Controllers will be loaded sequentially in the
      order determined by this column.&nbsp; After giving the controller a
      unique ID, select the Controller Type from the dropdown list.&nbsp; Pay
      particular attention to controllers that support both serial, USB, or
      Ethernet interfaces since these will usually be listed as different
      controller types.&nbsp; The “Active” column determines if a particular
      controller will be loaded or not.&nbsp; You may define a controller within
      this screen and not have it loaded when PowerHome starts by unchecking
      this column.&nbsp; The last step to defining a controller is the
      “Settings” button.&nbsp; You MUST click on this button for each controller
      when you initially declare it in order for its additional unique
      parameters to be created.&nbsp; Oftentimes, the default values are
      sufficient, but you must at least open the “Settings” window for the
      default values to be created.&nbsp; If you have a problem with the
      settings parameters and need to have the default values recreated, just
      change the Controller Type from the current value to any other value and
      then back again.&nbsp; This will erase your old values.&nbsp; When you
      click on the “Settings” button after having changed the Controller Type,
      you’ll get a new set of default values generated.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">
      Each controller 
type will have its own unique “Settings” screen dependant upon the controller 
type.&nbsp; However, some of these parameters may appear on more than one 
controller.&nbsp; Some of these common parameters are detailed 
below: </div>
