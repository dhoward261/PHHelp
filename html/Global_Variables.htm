    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Global variables are user defined storage areas.&nbsp;
      Users are able to declare a virtually unlimited number of global
      variables.&nbsp; Users define the global variable ID (up to 25 characters)
      and the contents or value of the global variable (up to 1024
      characters).&nbsp; Global variables can contain other global variables and
      can be "stacked" to achieve lengths greater than 1024.&nbsp; All
      information is stored in a character format.&nbsp; This includes numeric
      data.&nbsp; If a global variable contains numeric data and is used in a
      numeric operation, its contents will be converted into the appropriate
      numeric value.&nbsp; The user does not need to concern themselves with
      this for the most part.&nbsp; Global variables are declared in the global
      variable section of the PowerHome Explorer.&nbsp; An initial value can
      also be assigned at this time.&nbsp; Global variables can have their
      contents changed from within macros and formulas.&nbsp; Global variable
      contents can be referenced from within formulas and macros where global
      variable substitution is performed.&nbsp; Global variables maintain their
      state even when PowerHome is shutdown as they are stored within the
      database.</div>
