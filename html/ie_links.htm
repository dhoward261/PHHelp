    <div class="ph1"> Insteon Explorer - Links </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Current Device</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The Current Device window shows you the currently selected device whose
      controllers and responders you wish to view or modify. You may select a
      device to view by dropping down the "Insteon Device ID" column and
      scrolling to the appropriate device. You may also type the first few
      characters in this box to quickly jump to the appropriate place in the
      dropdown list.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Controllers of the selected device will be shown in the "Controllers (of
      Current Device)" list below. Responders (devices controlled by this
      device) will be shown in the "Responders (of Current Device)" list below.
      You may double-click anywhere in the "Current Device" row to refresh the
      "Controllers" and "Responders" windows if you wish to monitor on-going
      link activity.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Directly below the Current Device window and to the far left of the Links
      tab is a list of Insteon devices currently identified within PowerHome.
      Use this window to highlight devices to add as "Controllers" or
      "Responders" of the "Current Device". You may highlight a single device at
      a time by left-clicking on it. Highlight multiple devices by holding
      either the "Ctrl" or "Shift" keys while clicking on a device ID. You may
      alternately highlight / un-highlight ALL devices ID's by clicking on the
      "ID" column heading.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Once ID's are highlighted in the Device List, add them as either
      "Controllers" or "Responders" of the "Current Device" by dragging and
      dropping the currently highlighted devices to either the "Controllers" or
      "Responders" window or both to create cross-links.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Above the Device List are two buttons, the "Remove" button and the
      "Reverify" button. Both buttons may be either clicked or dragged to. The
      "Remove" button will delete any links dragged and dropped on it or all
      highlighted links in both the "Controllers" and "Responders" window if
      clicked. The deletion is simply a removal from the PowerHome database and
      does not affect actual link information in the devices themselves. To
      completely delete a link from both PowerHome AND the Insteon devices, drag
      and drop highlighted links from the "Controllers" or "Responders" window
      to the "Device List"</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Reverify" button will flag any links dragged to it for
      reverification. If the button is instead clicked, then all highlighted
      links in the "Controllers" and "Responders" windows will be flagged for
      reverification. This is handy because on occasion, poor Insteon
      communications can cause PowerHome to believe that a link no longer
      exists. This will usually be characterized by a "NOT FOUND" in the link
      status fields. After flagging links for reverification, you must "Save" in
      order for PowerHome to start reverifying links. Reverification causes
      PowerHome to requery the Insteon devices and validate that the flagged
      links truly exist properly within the device.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Refresh</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Refresh" option will requery the PowerHome database for any changes
      to Insteon devices. If you either Manually Added or Auto-Discovered a new
      Insteon device, you must "Refresh" in order for this device to appear in
      the Current Device list or Devices list. This option will also requery the
      "Controllers" and "Responders" link information. If you have made changes,
      you will be given the option to save them before the refresh takes place.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      This option is similar to "double-clicking" the "Current Device" in that
      the currently displayed screen of information will be refreshed, but
      different since ALL of the database information will be refreshed.
      Double-clicking ONLY refreshes the Controller and Responder information
      for the currently selected device.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Copy / Paste</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Copy" and "Paste" options allow you to easily duplicate links from
      one device to another. When the "Copy" option is selected, all selected
      "Controller" rows and selected "Responder" rows will be copied to a
      temporary buffer. You will also be given the option to include the
      "Current Device" as a "Responder" in subsequent "Paste" operations. You
      may then select another Current Device and choose the "Paste" option to
      copy the saved links to the new device. Depending upon the device and
      link, you may need to fill in additional information such as remote button
      number or group. These areas will be shown in red in their respective
      window.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Rebuild</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Rebuild" option causes PowerHome to rebuild all the links in the
      currently selected device. It does not matter what "Controller" or
      "Responder" rows are currently selected and only works on the currently
      selected Insteon device. This option will rebuild all of the links that
      PowerHome has listed as "Controller" or "Responder" links and will
      reprogram them into the selected device. This option is useful if you've
      performed a "hard reset" on the device and wish to rebuild the links. This
      option is also useful if the links in the device are fragmented (the list
      of links contain blank entries). You will be asked to confirm this
      operation. As soon as confirming, the rebuild will be added to the Pending
      queue immediately WITHOUT needing to save.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Save</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Save" option allows you to save any changes that you've made to the
      Current Device's links. You must save (or abandon) your changes before
      selecting another Insteon device as the Current Device. As soon as your
      changes are saved, the associated link changes will be added to the
      Insteon Pending Operations queue.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Controllers</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      This window lists Insteon devices that "control" the Current Device.
      Columns with a maroon heading color pertain to the controlling device.
      Columns with a blue heading color pertain to the controlled device (the
      device displayed in the "Current Device" window). You can edit the
      controllers group, the responders button, and the responders level and
      ramprate. You can select single rows by clicking the row, multiple rows by
      holding either the Control or Shift keys while clicking. You can also
      select or deselect ALL rows by clicking on the headings or anywhere else
      that is not specifically a row. Selected rows may be deleted (removed from
      the Insteon device AND the PowerHome database) by dragging and dropping to
      the "Device List" on the left. You may also drag and drop the selected
      rows to the "Remove" button to have the links merely deleted from the
      PowerHome database (the actual links in the device will still remain).</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Controllers Create</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Create" option will attempt to create PowerHome Insteon Devices for
      all selected Controllers with an ID of [ID NOT FOUND]. To use this option,
      you must first select the controllers with [ID NOT FOUND] you wish to
      correct. PowerHome will first add them to the PLC internal database and
      then attempt communication with a Ping command. If the Ping is successful,
      then the PowerHome Insteon Device will be created with an ID in the form
      of "NEW SPIDER ??" where ?? is a sequential unique number.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Responders</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      This window lists Insteon devices that "respond" to (are controlled by)
      the device shown in the Current Devices window. Columns with a green
      heading color pertain to the controlled (responding) device. Columns with
      a blue heading color pertain to the controlling device (the device
      displayed in the Current Device window). You can edit the controllers
      group, the responders button, and the responders level and ramprate. You
      can select single rows by clicking the row, multiple rows by holding
      either the Control or Shift keys while clicking. You can also select or
      deselect ALL rows by clicking on the headings or anywhere else that is not
      specifically a row. Selected rows may be deleted by dragging and dropping
      to the "Device List" on the left. This will delete the actual links from
      the associated devices as well as from the PowerHome database. If you opt
      to drag and drop the selected links to the "Remove" button instead, then
      the links will ONLY be deleted from the PowerHome database leaving the
      actual links in the devices intact.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Responders Create</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      The "Create" option will attempt to create PowerHome Insteon Devices for
      all selected Responders with an ID of [ID NOT FOUND]. To use this option,
      you must first select the responders with [ID NOT FOUND] you wish to
      correct. PowerHome will first add them to the PLC internal database and
      then attempt communication with a Ping command. If the Ping is successful,
      then the PowerHome Insteon Device will be created with an ID in the form
      of "NEW SPIDER ??" where ?? is a sequential unique number.</div>
