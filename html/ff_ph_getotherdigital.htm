<div class=ph10>Return value</div>
<div class=ph11>

Long. Returns the value of the digital input/output point you requested.  A 0 means the input is off, a 1 means the input is on.  –1 is returned if the controller is not available, -2 is returned if digital input/output is not supported by the controller, -3 is returned if the unit is out of range, -4 is returned if the point is out of range.

<div class=ph12>Usage</div>
<div class=ph13>

Currently only supported by the CPU-XA/Ocelot (with SECU-16, SECU-16I, or RLY-8 interface), the Velleman K8000 controller, and the Elk M1 Gold.  
<br><br>
To use this function with the CPU-XA/Ocelot, specify the ID of the controller whose type is CPU-XA/Ocelot.  The "unit" must be a number from 1 to 128 corresponding with the address of the SECU-16, SECU-16I, or RLY-8 whose digital I/O you wish to retrieve.  The "point" must be a number from 0 to 15 and corresponds to the specific point on the addressed SECU-16, SECU-16I, or RLY-8.
<br><br>
To use this function with the Velleman K8000, specify the ID of the controller whose type is K8000.  The "unit" value must be 0.  The "point" value must be a number from 1 to 64 and corresponds to the specific point whose digital I/O you wish to retrieve the status of.
<br><br>
For use with the Elk M1 Gold, specify the ID of the Elk M1 controller.  For the "Unit" and "Point" properties, the Elk M1 Gold supports two different numbering schemes.  You can set the "unit" value to 0 and then set the "Point" value to the Elk logical point value.  You can also set the "Unit" to the address of any external modules (use 0 for the on-board points) and the "Point" to the actual point value on the external board.
