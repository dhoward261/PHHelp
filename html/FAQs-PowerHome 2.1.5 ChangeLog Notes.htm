      FAQ: Changelog for PowerHome 2.1.5</div>
    <div class="ph2">Knowledge Notes </div>
    <div class="ph3">
      <p>Here is the changelog for 2.1.5. <br>
        <br>
        NOTE: This changelog represents cumulative changes since version 2.1b. </p>
      <p>Version 2.1.4 did not have a changelog, so changes in that version
        (that still exist in 2.1.5) will be listed here.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        PowerHome code has been updated to the latest version of PowerBuilder
        libraries (version 12.5).&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Database engine has been upgraded to SQL Anywhere 11 from Adaptive
        Server Anywhere 7.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New Insteon engine with full I2CS support. All previous Insteon bugs
        should be resolved. New Insteon tables hold all published Insteon device
        types and will be auto-added to the Insteon Types table during auto
        discovery.&nbsp;NOTE that some I2CS devices may be firewalled and not
        readily "discovered" by programatic methods. See discussion about this
        issue in "FAQs-Setting up Thermostats in PH 2.1.5" for more information
        on how to resolve this, should it be a problem. <br>
        <br>
        I2CS Thermostats now fully supported.&nbsp;NOTE: PH Version 2.1.5 on,
        uses a significantly different approach to Thermostat support than
        previous PH Versions did. See Help File "FAQs-Setting up Thermostats in
        PH 2.1.5" for detailed information. <br>
        <br>
        New Options window for Insteon devices. Allows for extended programming
        of various Insteon devices.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ph11">The Options window is accessed via the Options button in the Insteon Explorer Devices tab.</p>
      <p><img src="images/Options Window.png" alt="Options Window" width="826" height="346" class="ph11"><br>
        <br>
        Insteon KPL config has been updated to use the Insteon KPL configuration
        commands (instead of the old peek/poke memory locations). KPL tab has
        been removed from Insteon Explorer and added to the new Insteon Options
        window. Peek/Poke commands still available for legacy devices.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Added support for Insteon GarageHawk.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Changed most timing operations within PowerHome to a single background
        multi-threaded object. Should solve contention issues between multiple
        components.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        All references to MSCOMM32 (Microsoft COMM control) have been removed.
        Serial port controls have all been replaced with COMM32 control. Allows
        COM ports 1 thur 255.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        All references to MSWINSCK (Microsoft Winsock control) have been
        removed. All socket controls have been upgraded with Catalyst 8
        controls.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        All plugins have been brought up to current controls (serial/winsock)
        and current codebase (PowerBuilder plugins are 12.5). This should solve
        the problems people were having with the PH_CID plugin.<br>
        <br>
        Eventlog and weblog tables have been moved to their own database
        (phlogs.db). No more corrupt databases due to the eventlog and weblog
        growing to very large sizes.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Eventlog report has been rewritten as a background thead with the option
        to cancel retrieval. No more hanging of PowerHome when retrieving very
        large logs. Start reviewing log immediately while retrieval continues in
        the background.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New log options. Resume Macro will fire when a macro is resumed from
        waiting. Verbose macro will cause the existing Macro and the new Resume
        Macro to also display in the <strong>Event Log</strong> the values of [LOCAL1] thru [LOCAL10] and [TEMP1]
        thru [TEMP10]. Now you'll be able to get a better idea of what is going
      on with your macros until the macro debugger is released.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ph11">These posting parameters are accessed in the PowerHome Explorer&gt;Setup&gt;Logs object. </p>
      <p><img src="images/LOGS-posting.png" alt="LOGS-Posting" width="912" height="303" class="ph11"><br>
        <br>
        New Analog device types. Dedicated analog types for Insteon GarageHawk,
        IOLinc, EZRain/EZFlora, Insteon Responder Group (eliminates need for
        virtual Insteon devices), etc. Allows for complete control of these
        devices without having to do any scripting.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Thermostats table has been deprecated. Insteon and Elk Thermostats have
        their own individual device types (Temperature, Cool SetPoint, etc) in
        the Analog I/O table.&nbsp;While this is a substantial improvement,
        unfortunately it means that prior Thermostat coding in earlier versions
        of PH will have to be re-visited in order to obtain full benefits. See
        Help File "FAQs-Setting up Thermostats in PH 2.1.5" for detailed
        information. <br>
        <br>
        Timed Events routine has been reworked to solve problem with
        disappearing timed events. Now using update instead of Delete/Insert
        during timed event processing.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New labeling system added. Add one or more user defined labels to
        devices, macros, triggers, etc. Filter by label in PowerHome Explorer
        and Device Status screen. Group devices, formulas, macros, etc. together
        logically.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New 1-wire controller type. Support 1-wire devices directly within
        PowerHome. This controller runs in a separate thread due to the overhead
        of 1-wire communications.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New generic parallel port controller type.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New CM15A controller type. Supports both PLC and RF capabilities of this
        device.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New Insteon SmartLinc/NetLinc/Hub controller type. Connect directly to
        Insteon IP capable PLM's without having to use a virtual serial
        port.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Virtual Serial Port plugin updated to use the latest version 7.2 of
        Eltima controls. Plugin rewritten to be an activex EXE (rather than OCX)
        for better reliability and stability.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Reworked execution queue to support priority and top items. See
        ph_postexequeue function.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Direct control and status of Controllers from the PowerHome UI. Under
        Help-&gt;About-&gt;Controllers, you'll be able to see the connect status
        of the controllers as well as change the status.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        New options to select lines in a macro and delete, cut, copy, or paste
      them to other macros (or the current macro).&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="ph11">To use this feature CTRL-Click on any Macro line of code
        and the entire line will be selected. Additional CTRL-Clicks will select
        additional individual lines of code, while a Shift_Click will select all
        lines between the first and last Click. </p>
      <p class="ph11"><img src="images/Macro%20Select.png" alt="Macro Cut/Paste"

          height="545" width="592"></p>
      <p class="ph11">Once your Selection is made, Right-Click the mouse
        anywhere in the Macro and a context menu will appear. Choose the
        "Selected" menu item and the desired action.</p>
      <p class="ph11">If you Cut/Copy, you can Paste it in this or another
        Macro. After you select a target row, you can then Paste and the
        clipboard content will be Inserted at that location. It inserts, not
        overwrites, so following lines will be moved down to make room. </p>
      New regular expression capability (available in functions ph_regex2,
      ph_regexdiff2, and ph_regexsnap2). This regular expression syntax is the
      same as VB and offers many more options than the regex functionality in
      Scintilla. Reference this website for very detailed documentation
      concerning this syntax: http://www.regular-expressions.info/vb.html&nbsp;<br>
      <p> Webserver and Socket Server rewritten to eliminate contention
        errors.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Webserver has additional security options (cookie) and now supports
        SSL.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        SMTP email functions have all been rewritten to use Catalyst SMTP
        control vs a raw socket. Improved stability and performance. New
        ph_sendsmtpemailasync function allows you send email asynchronously
        rather than holding up PowerHome execution waiting for the email
        function to return.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Numerous bugfixes, critical error fixes, and tweaks throughout. Too many
        to list. Since alot of the base code is completely new, please re-report
        any bugs or critical errors as they occur.&nbsp;<br>
