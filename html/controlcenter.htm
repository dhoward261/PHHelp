      Control Center
    </div>
    <div class="indent1 padtop1">
      The Control Center is the main PowerHome window.&nbsp; This window can be
      set from within Preferences to behave as a normal window with minimize and
      maximize buttons or can be set to appear as a background for other
      windows.&nbsp; You can also have the Control Center available on remote
      machines via the PowerHome Remote Clients. The Control Center is fully
      user definable with the number of tabs that it contains, what appears on
      each tab, as well as the actions that any buttons on the tab may
      perform.&nbsp; You can place background bitmaps on any tab which could
      contain a floormap or an actual picture of an Infrared remote control in
      which you place hotspots which can be clicked to perform the desired
      actions.&nbsp; The buttons that you place on the Control Center can be X10
      commands, IR commands, Macros, or Send Keys.&nbsp; You can assign
      virtually any keystroke combination to these buttons as well as using the
      mouse to activate them or using a touch screen.</div>
    <div class="indent1 padtop1">
      There can only be one Control Center open.&nbsp; It can be opened from the
      toolbar, from the menu Control / Control Center, or by pressing the hotkey
      'Alt-F1'.&nbsp; This hotkey combination works anywhere from within
      PowerHome and will instantly bring up the Control Center.&nbsp; This is
      useful if you are trying to use an infrared or RF keyboard without a
      monitor handy as a super wireless remote.&nbsp; Once the control center is
      active, you can select the current tab by either clicking on it or
      pressing a hotkey combination 'F1' thru 'F12' and 'Shift-F1' thru
      'Shift-F12'.&nbsp; The far left tab will always be 'F1'.&nbsp; The tab to
      the right of this will be 'F2', etc.&nbsp; If you have more than 12 tabs,
      then the 13th tab will be 'Shift-F1', etc.&nbsp; You cannot hotkey to tabs
      above 24 but you can still mouse to them.&nbsp; You create tabs for the
      Control Center from the Tabs section of the PowerHome Explorer.&nbsp; You
      can also set the tabs order from within this maintenance area also.</div>
