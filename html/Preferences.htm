    <div class="ph1"> Preferences </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Web Center</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">The Web Center is an internally controlled version of
      Internet Explorer.&nbsp; It is essentially a web browser within a
      PowerHome window.&nbsp; You may set the startup webpage to be any URL you
      like, either internal or external to PowerHome.&nbsp; This parameter
      controls whether the Web Center will appear within PowerHome as a normal
      window or will appear as a background.&nbsp; If a screen is a window, it
      can be resized, moved, minimized, or closed.&nbsp; A background does not
      have a title bar and cannot be closed or moved.&nbsp; However, windows or
      other backgrounds may appear on top of a background, thereby obscuring
      it.&nbsp; Choose whether you want the Web Center to be Windowed or
      Background.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Startup Window</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">When PowerHome is launched or reinitialized, you can
      have it default open one of several windows.&nbsp; Choose the window you
      want PowerHome to automatically launch from this dropdown.&nbsp; You may
      also create a trigger on Startup or ReInit and call functions to launch
      additional windows or windows not in the dropdown.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Auto Window Timeout</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">PowerHome may occasionally pop-up informational or
      selection type windows.&nbsp; These windows all have a countdown timer in
      which the window will automatically close or choose the default selection
      and automatically close.&nbsp; This value controls how long that countdown
      timer is.&nbsp; The default value is 5.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Drop Down Lines</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">The Drop Down Line parameter is default set to 0 and
      this is fine as the functionality for this has not been fully implemented
      yet.&nbsp; The only place that it currently has an effect is on the drop
      down for the Macro Player on the main PowerHome frame.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Quiet Start</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">When PowerHome starts, it will normally pop-up two
      selection windows.&nbsp; The first window will ask if you want to
      automatically turn Timed Events on.&nbsp; If the answer is yes (the
      default), the next selection window will ask if you want to Execute Past
      Due Timed Events (the default is yes).&nbsp; Both of these windows are
      determined by other parameters below.&nbsp; If Quiet Start is checked,
      both of these windows are suppressed with their default values being
      automatically executed (assuming the parameters below are set to normally
      cause these windows to be displayed).</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Minimize to System Tray</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Checking this option will cause PowerHome to minimize
      to the system tray when the main PowerHome frame is minimized.&nbsp; If
      this option is not checked, PowerHome will minimize to the Start bar like
      most Windows applications.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Confirm Shutdown</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Checking this parameter will cause PowerHome to
      display a messagebox before it shuts down confirming that you indeed would
      like to shutdown.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Export Append</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Checking this parameter will cause PowerHome to
      append any exports made from the PowerHome Explorer to an already existing
      file rather than overwriting the file if it already exists.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Single Explorer Window</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Within PowerHome, some windows are only allowed a
      single instance to be opened.&nbsp; The Control Center, the Web Center,
      Device Status, etc. are examples of windows that can only be opened a
      single time.&nbsp; The PowerHome Explorer window however may be opened
      multiple times with a different set of data displayed within each
      window.&nbsp; Checking this option will override the normal operation and
      allow only a single PowerHome Explorer window to be opened.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Explorer Color Scheme</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This section allows you to customize the color scheme
      used in the PowerHome Explorer.&nbsp; You can set the foreground and
      background colors for the left hand pane (the tree) and the foreground and
      background colors for both even and odd rows in the right hand pane
      maintenance screens.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Activate Timed Events at Startup</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Checking this option will cause PowerHome to
      automatically start the Timed Event timer upon startup.&nbsp; If “Quiet
      Start” is not checked, a selection window will be displayed with a
      countdown timer asking if you want to start the Timed Event timer.&nbsp;
      The default value will be “yes”.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Execute Past Timed Events at Startup</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">If “Activate Timed Events at Startup” is checked (and
      the default of yes is selected), PowerHome will next pop-up a selection
      window asking if past timed events should be executed (the default is
      yes).&nbsp; This means that any events that should have been executed in
      the past will all be executed.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1"> If you don’t Execute Past Timed Events at Startup,
      then PowerHome will automatically calculate the appropriate time for the
      Timed Event to next be run.&nbsp; If it has been a long time since
      PowerHome was last run with a lot of past due Timed Events, it could take
      an extremely long time for PowerHome to catch up.&nbsp; In this case, it
      would be best to let Timed Events automatically start, but not execute
      past due events.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Resume Waiting Macros</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">When a macro is made to wait with the “Wait” command,
      its state is written to the database.&nbsp; If PowerHome were to be
      shutdown and restarted (manual or power failure), checking this box would
      cause any macros which were waiting prior to the shutdown or reinit to
      resume and execute.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Load Controllers</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Checking this parameter will cause PowerHome to
      automatically start any controllers defined in the “Controllers” section
      of the PowerHome Explorer Setup.&nbsp; Normally you would want to start
      controllers when PowerHome is launched, but if there is a problem with a
      controller causing PowerHome to hang or error out, you can uncheck this
      box allowing PowerHome to start without an error so that the problem can
      be fixed.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Load Plugins</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Checking this parameter will cause any defined
      Plugins to automatically be started when PowerHome starts.&nbsp; However,
      you may want to temporarily disable the loading of plugins for reasons
      similar to those listed in the “Load Controllers” section.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Event Logging</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">The next parameter controls what events are logged in
      the Event Log.&nbsp; You can select to log only the events that you are
      interested in tracking.&nbsp; I recommend that you initially log every
      event until you are comfortable with PowerHome as the log is extremely
      useful in troubleshooting any problems you may be having.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1"> Proxy Server</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">If you only have access to the internet via a proxy
      server, this section allows you to define the parameters so that PowerHome
      can access the internet for freedb access on the formula function
      ph_geturl.</div>
