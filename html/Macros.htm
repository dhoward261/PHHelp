    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Macros are the heart of the PowerHome program.&nbsp;
      It is here that most actions are defined and if-then logic is
      performed.&nbsp; Having well defined and thought out macros will enable
      you to maximize your use of the PowerHome Program.&nbsp; From within
      macros you can: control Insteon, UPB, and X10 devices, send infrared
      commands, call other macros, set global variables, set certain system
      variables, launch applications, switch to other applications, perform a
      Send Keys, initiate a dial-up connection, disconnect a dial-up connection,
      send Email, perform Text to Speech, create timed events, play a CD jukebox
      playlist, perform delays, trim the event log, get input, post a
      messagebox, perform direct SQL on the database, retrieve data from the
      database, clear the X10 history variables, and nearly any other function
      for automation control.&nbsp; The Formula language used within macros
      allows for sophisticated if-then-else logic and looping.&nbsp; Macros are
      defined within the Macro section of the PowerHome Explorer.</div>
