    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> Triggers are based upon external actions.&nbsp;
      Triggers can be declared for a number of external events including the
      sending and receiving of Insteon, UPB, X10, and Infrared signals, by
      plugins, by Windows messages, incoming Socket connections, global variable
      changes, etc.&nbsp; Anytime you want to perform an action based upon some
      other action occurring, you’ll probably want to define a trigger.&nbsp;
      Triggers also include a Boolean formula which is checked whenever a
      trigger fires.&nbsp; If the formula is true then the trigger's action is
      performed.&nbsp; Actions can be either a Macro, Send Keys, Raw formula, or
      a Device Control string.&nbsp; Triggers are declared from within the
      Triggers section of the PowerHome Explorer.</div>
