FAQ: UNDO/REDO </div>

<div class=ph2>Knowledge Notes </div>

<div class=ph3>
  <p>A CTRL-Z will <strong>UNDO</strong> changes as most Windows programs do. Within the PowerHome Explorer, an F10 will <strong>UNDO</strong> everything done on the current detail window.  Once you leave a detail window, the changes are permanent. A CTRL-Y will <strong>REDO</strong> actions, as with most Windows programs. </p>
  <p>When you delete a macro line, two things happen...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
     First, the line is deleted, then</li>
    <li>the rest of the lines are renumbered. </li>
  </ul>
So the first CTRL-Z undoes the renumbering and the second CTRL-Z undoes the delete. <p>

F10 will “Undo All” (up to the last save).<p>

There is also a CTRL-Y for redo. <p>
 
Thus if you're working on a screen and have made multiple changes, a single F10 will revert you back to where you were when you first entered the screen.  <p>

You can also ctrl-z your way back to this point.  But if you hit F5 (Save/Refresh) or navigate to a different Explorer detail screen, your changes are saved to the database and are permanent. <p>
 
These 3 options are also available and shown on the PH Explorer toolbar (last 3 buttons) and the "Edit" menu. <br>
