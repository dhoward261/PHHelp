<DIV class=ph1>Elk M1 Gold as a PowerHome Controller </DIV>
<P>Using the Elk M1 Gold as a PowerHome controller:</P>
<P>You must first set the Elk up as a PowerHome controller. This can be done 
from the PowerHome Explorer under PowerHome|Setup|Controllers. You may connect 
to the Elk directly using a serial connection or via ethernet if you have an 
M1XEP.</P>
<P>After creating the Elk controller, click the "Settings" button to define the 
COM port (or IP address and Port) and the Analog Poll Interval. The Analog Poll 
Interval determines in seconds, how often PowerHome will query the Elk for the 
current value of any input points defined as analog inputs. You must also use 
the Elk RM utility to configure the Elk serial port for 115200 bps or properly 
configure the ethernet settings.</P>
<P>PowerHome provides support for all aspects of the Elk M1 Gold. The Elks 
lighting devices (X10, Insteon, etc.) are available as X10 devices in PowerHome. 
The&nbsp;digital (16 multiple-state) inputs on the Elk and external boards are 
available as Multi-State Inputs in the Analog I/O screen. Alternatively, if 
you're only interested in the open/close status of the multi-state inputs, you 
can define these points as Digital Inputs in the Digital I/O screen.&nbsp; The 
Elk digital outputs are available within PowerHome as Digital Outputs in the 
Digital I/O screen. Inputs on the Elk setup as analog inputs are available 
within PowerHome as analog inputs in the Analog I/O screen. Elk temperature 
inputs can be declared as "Temperature" in the Analog I/O screen. The Elk 
digital inputs, if defined as Multi-State Inputs on the analog I/O screen, have 
a built in formula that will display appropriate values automatically. You can 
however override these built in formulas by declaring your own. All analog 
inputs, digital inputs, digital outputs, and lighting devices are automatically 
available within the PowerHome Device status screen. Manipulation and reading of 
these control points are also available using appropriate PowerHome functions 
and macro commands.&nbsp; PowerHome also supports defining inputs (and triggers) 
for the Elk "Arm Status", "Arm State", and "Alarm State".&nbsp; The definition 
for these points are all done in the Analog I/O screen.</P>
<P>When defining digital outputs, digital inputs, and analog inputs, the 
controller will be the ID of the Elk controller, the unit will be the board 
number from 1 to 13 (1 is used for the controls onboard the Elk), and the point 
will be the individual device number on the board from 1 to 16. Temperature 
inputs will have a unit of&nbsp;1 for temperature probes,&nbsp;2 for keypads, 
and&nbsp;3 for thermostats. The point value for temperature inputs will be from 
1 to 16 corresponding with the available units in each category.&nbsp; There is 
also an alternative numbering scheme that is allowed that matches the Elk RM 
numbering scheme rather than the unit number / point number method.&nbsp; Using 
this method, set the Unit to 0.&nbsp; The Point will then be a value starting at 
1.&nbsp; For example, if you are declaring the 5th input on expansion board 3, 
you can use either Unit 3, Point 5 or Unit 0, Point 37.</P>
<P>In order for PowerHome to work properly with the above Elk controls, you MUST 
also use the Elk RM configuration software to setup each control appropriately. 
This cannot be done from within PowerHome since the protocol for this 
configuration is proprietary and is not made available to developers. This is 
less painless if using the ethernet interface since both PowerHome and the Elk 
RM software will be able to connect simultaneously rather than just one software 
at a time.</P>
<P>PowerHome also supports standard triggers for the above Elk control types. 
When a digital output changes state either from programming internal to the Elk 
or from PowerHome control, a digital output trigger will be fired. Similarly, 
when an Elk input changes state, a PowerHome Multi-State Input trigger or 
Digital Input trigger will automatically be fired. When an analog input changes, 
a PowerHome Analog Input trigger will be fired. For Elk Temperature devices 
(Temp Probe, Keypad, Thermostat), a Temperature trigger will be fired.&nbsp; For 
lighting devices, the appropriate X10 In and X10 Out triggers will be fired.</P>
<P>The standard functions ph_getothervar, ph_setothervar, ph_getothertimer, and 
ph_setothertimer may be used to access and update the Elk Custom values. These 
values are numbered from 1 to 20. Use the ph_getothervar and ph_setothervar to 
access and update custom values that are either numbers or timers. Use 
ph_getothertimer and ph_setothertimer to access custom values that are 
configured as time of day. For time of day custom values, pass the data as an 
integer representing the time. For example, to pass 9:40 pm, the value should be 
set to 2140.</P>
<P>PowerHome also supports all of the additional control features within the 
Elk. In addition to the standard triggers defined above, PowerHome will also 
fire the Generic Controller Trigger for certain Elk specific functions. These 
are detailed below:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>System Log Data Update: If Elk Global Programming Location 35 is enabled, 
  PowerHome will fire the Generic Controller Trigger with a trigger number of 1 
  and a trigger value of 1. All of the data contained within the command will be 
  available in the [TEMP] variables. 
  <LI>Tasks Change Update: If Elk Global Programming Location 38 is enabled, the 
  Generic Controller Trigger will be fired with a trigger number of 2 and a 
  trigger value matching the task number (1 to 32). 
  <LI>Keypad KeyChange Update: If Elk Global Programming Location 40 is enabled, 
  the GCT will be fired with a trigger number of 3 and a trigger value of 1. 
  <LI>Send Valid User Number and Invalid User Code: The GCT trigger will be 
  fired with a trigger number of 4 and a trigger value of 1. 
  <LI>Reply Arming Status Report Data: If Elk Global Programming Location 40 
  (transmit Keypad keys) is enabled, then the GCT trigger will be fired with a 
  trigger number of 5 and a trigger value of 1. </LI></UL>
<P>Support for the Elk specific control commands is available using the 
ph_ctlrcmd and ph_ctlrcmd1 functions. The specific controller command values and 
parameters are detailed below. To send an "Arming Status Request" command, the 
function would look like: ph_ctlrcmd1("ELKID",120,0,0,"","",1)</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Arming Status Request - 120. No parms. Seconds returned in ret1. Data 
  returned in ret3.

  <LI>Request Change User Code - 360. Codenum in parm1, areamask in parm2, 
  oldcode in parm3, newcode in parm4. Return data in ret1. </LI></UL>
<P>In addition to the above Controller commands supported by the Elk, there are 
a number of "Queued" commands that are also available for the Elk. "Queued" 
commands are normal tasks supported by controllers such as Send X10, Play IR, 
and Set Digital. The standard "Queued" commands such as the ones just listed are 
available by using the appropriate PowerHome functions or macro commands (such 
as ph_x10, ph_ir, etc). To access the non-standard queued commands supported by 
the Elk, use the PowerHome ph_ctlrsq function. An example of arm to away in area 
1 with a usercode of 1234 would be: ph_ctlrsq("ELKCTLRID",121,"1234",1,1). 
Details on the Elk specific queued commands are below:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Arm and Disarm commands - 121. User Code in parm1, level in parm2, and 
  area in parm3. 
  <LI>Speak Word at Voice Siren Output - 211. Word index in parm2. 
  <LI>Speak Phrase at Voice Siren Output - 212. Phrase index in parm2. 
  <LI>Task Activation - 221. Task index in parm2. 
  <LI>Display Text on LCD Screen - 231. Text in parm1, Flags in parm2, timeout 
  in parm3. 
  <LI>Set Thermostat Data - 301. Value in parm1, Tstat in parm2, element in 
  parm3. </LI></UL>
