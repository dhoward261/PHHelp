<div class=ph10>Return value</div>
<div class=ph11>

Integer.  Returns a 0 on commands 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Returns the status of the TTS engine on command 6.  With command 6, a return of 0 means the TTS engine is not currently speaking.  A value of 1 means that the TTS engine is currently speaking or is paused in speaking.

</div>
<div class=ph12>Usage</div>
<div class=ph13>

The Alert TTS engine allows you override the default TTS engine.  If the default TTS engine is in the middle of speaking, you can issue an Alert TTS command and the default engine will be paused, the Alert TTS will be spoken and when done, will resume speaking where it left off in the default TTS engine.  The default and alert TTS engines may have different voices.  In order to use the Alert TTS engine, you must have your TTS engine in the Setup section of PowerHome set to "SAPI 5/w Alert".
