    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome is structured around a relational database
      management system.&nbsp; The database engine that is used is Sybase SQL
      Anywhere 11.&nbsp; This is a SQL based database that is accessible via
      ODBC from a number of programs including Microsoft Access.&nbsp;
      Typically, only advanced users with knowledge of databases and SQL would
      make use of this feature as all database maintenance is fully supported
      from within PowerHome.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome is made up of multiple core sections.&nbsp;
      Understanding these core sections and how they interact with one another
      is essential to achieving maximum functionality from the PowerHome
      program. </div>
