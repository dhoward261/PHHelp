    <div class="ph1"> Web </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome includes an internal web server allowing for
      remote web based control and monitoring of your system.&nbsp; You can use
      the system generated web pages which provide most of the support you would
      ever need and/or you can create your own dynamic content using PSP
      (PowerHome Server Pages).&nbsp; With this formula language, you can
      totally customize the web interface that you are presented with for
      PowerHome control.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Enable Web Server</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Check this box if you want to make the internal web
      server available. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Allow Guest on Internal Pages</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">If the web server is enabled, you may also choose
      whether to allow the guest login to access the internal web pages.&nbsp;
      The guest account is userid guest with a password of guest.&nbsp; The
      guest account cannot make changes to your system with the internal web
      pages and is limited in what it can see.&nbsp; You may still have
      sensitive information contained within certain areas of your setup that
      you don’t want the guest account to see.&nbsp; Unless you have a good
      reason, you should leave the guest account disabled. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Web Server Directory</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">The web server directory should be set to where
      PowerHome installed its web files.&nbsp; This directory should be default
      located in C:\Program Files\PowerHome\Web.&nbsp; If you are creating
      custom HTML or PSP pages to be served up by the internal web server, you
      should place them in this directory or a subdirectory of it. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Web Server Port</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Set the web server port to the port that you would
      like to use.&nbsp; If this is your only web server, you should set this to
      80 as that is the default port generally used by web servers.&nbsp; You
      can set this to a different value, but you will have to enter the port
      number in the address line of your browser to access PowerHome. </div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Enable Smart NextURL</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This parameter controls how PowerHome processes the
      next URL for internal PH web addresses.&nbsp; If this value is unchecked
      or the next URL is not an internal address, PowerHome uses a redirect to
      cause the browser to load the next URL.&nbsp; If this parameter is checked
      (and the next URL is an internal PH URL), the PowerHome webserver will
      automatically execute the appropriate next URL code and return it’s HTML
      rather than forcing a redirect first.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Master UserID and Password</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Set the userid and password to appropriate values for
      you to access the system.&nbsp; The password is hidden on this screen.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Access</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">Within this section you can set the authorization
      level for each type of external web page that can be served by the
      PowerHome web server.&nbsp; If you set the PSP pages as ‘Any’, you can use
      internal PSP functions for a finer level of control over user access.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Blacklisted IP’s</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">You may enter any number of blacklisted IP masks
      within this section.&nbsp; A blacklisted IP is not allowed access to the
      PowerHome webserver under any circumstances.&nbsp; When a request is made
      to the webserver, the referrers IP is checked to see if it is
      blacklisted.&nbsp; If not, it is then checked to see if it’s
      trusted.&nbsp; If not, it is then checked for an appropriate userid and
      password.&nbsp; You may declare the masks as an exact IP or include an
      asterisk character as a wildcard.&nbsp; When entering multiple trusted
      IP’s, separate them with a ; (semicolon).</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Trusted IP’s</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">You may enter any number of trusted IP masks within
      this section.&nbsp; A trusted IP is not required to enter a userid /
      password and will have the same authorization as the master user.&nbsp;
      You may declare the masks as an exact IP or include an asterisk character
      as a wildcard.&nbsp; If you were running an internal network at home and
      wanted all of your internal IP’s to be trusted, you could enter an IP mask
      of 192.168.0.*.&nbsp; When entering multiple trusted IP’s, separate them
      with a ; (semicolon).</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Main Page</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This section allows you to declare the default main
      page for the PowerHome webserver.&nbsp; Unless you’re using PSP to write
      your own webpages and wish to use your own main page, you should leave
      these values at their default.&nbsp; The main page is the URL that is
      loaded when accessing built in secondary pages and the menu option shows
      “Main”.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Menu</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">This section allows you define the 
URL’s that appear on the default main page menu.&nbsp; All of the default 
internal pages will initially appear in the menu.&nbsp; You can remove pages if 
you desire (use the “Default Menu” button to restore these if you like) or add 
additional entries if you’ve created your own custom pages. </div>
