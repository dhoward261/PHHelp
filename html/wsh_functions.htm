    <div class="ph1"> Windows Script Host Functions </div>
    <p>PowerHome includes a number of PowerHome specific 
functions that extend the Windows Script Host environment and allows it to interact with
      PowerHome. Nearly ALL of the PowerHome "ph_" functions (only the functions
      that start with ph_ are extended to WSH) are available in a
      Windows Script Host version. For example, the ph_addtoglobal function
      available within the PowerHome internal formula environment is also
      available within Windows Script Host as ph.addtoglobal. Instead
      of&nbsp;duplicating every function listed in this Help file under the
      Formulas-&gt;Functions section ( <A href="html%5Cformula_functions.htm">Formula
        Functions</A>)&nbsp;under the Windows Script Host functions, this
      section will only document the differences in between the two. To use a
      ph_ function within Windows Script Host, you just have to change the "ph_"
      to "ph.".</p>
    <p>Listed below are the differences:</p>
<div>
<table width="100%">
  
  <tr>
    <td><span class=ph6_1 
      >ph_ Formula 
      function</span></td>
    <td><span class=ph7 
      >Windows 
      Script Host equivalent</span></td></tr>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8_1>ph_and</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>ph.bitand</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8_1>ph_not</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>ph.lognot</TD></TR>

    <TD class=ph8_1>ph_or</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>ph.bitor</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8_1>ph_xor</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>ph.bitxor</TD></TR></table></div><BR>The PowerHome formula 
functions ph_setglobal_a and ph_setglobal_s also have their equivalent in WSH as 
ph.setglobal_a and ph.setglobal_s. WSH also has some additional functions: 
ph.setglobal_d, ph.setglobal_dt, ph.setglobal_n and ph.setglobal_t.<BR><BR>The PowerHome formula functions ph.setvars_a and 
ph_setvars_s have WSH equivalents ph.setvars_a and ph.setvars_s. WSH also 
includes the functions ph.setvars_d, ph.setvars_dt, ph.setvars_n, and 
ph.setvars_t. <BR><BR>If you should encounter a ph_ formula function that does 
not appear to be duplicated as a WSH ph. function or 
doesnt work as intended, you can always embed the 
function in a formula string and execute it using 
the generic ph.formula function.
