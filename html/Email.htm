    <div class="indent2 padtop1">This section controls whether or not PowerHome will
      process control Email with embedded Send Keys, Formulas, or
      Macros.&nbsp;&nbsp; PowerHome has the ability to retrieve Email at

      can restrict processing of control Email to only the addresses that you
      specify.&nbsp; If you choose this option, enter the Email addresses you
      will process Email from in the Restricted Email Control Addresses field..</div>

      characters within the body of the email to be interpreted as control
      characters.&nbsp; Many free email accounts or email sent via cellphones
      add additional text to the email body.&nbsp; Use this field to enter a
      string of characters that you will add to your control email to signify
      the end of the control email body.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome uses MAPI for its Email processing and you
      must have a MAPI compliant Email client properly setup.&nbsp; Any Email
      that is not intended for PowerHome will be retrieved but left unaltered in
      the inbox of your MAPI compliant client. </div>
