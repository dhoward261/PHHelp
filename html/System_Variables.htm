    <div class="indent2 padtop1"> System variables are system defined storage
      areas.&nbsp; They are different from global variables because the user has
      little control over most of them.&nbsp; They are also only stored within
      RAM and when PowerHome is shutdown they lose their values.&nbsp; System
      variables can be accessed just the same as Global Variables.&nbsp; The
      System Variables that are modifiable by the user have virtually no limit
      to the amount of data that may be stored within them (a little more than 4
      gigabytes).&nbsp; Example system variables include X10 status, Sunrise,
      Sunset, local variables, temporary variables, and the Previous Incoming
      X10 buffer.</div>
