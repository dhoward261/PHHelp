<div class=ph10>Return value</div>
<div class=ph11>

String.  Returns data from the remote device.  If an error occurs, it will be in the form: "*ERROR* - XXX".  Special characters can be sent using this function by converting them to 3 digit ASCII and escaping the sequence with a '\' character.  So to send a carriage return as part of the data, use \013 and be sure to include a 2 in the flags sum.  If the data being returned by the function is likely to contain characters outside of the normal character range (32 to 125) then add a 4 to the flags sum so that these characters will be returned in the escaped 3 digit ASCII form.  Keep in mind if you are using escaped characters that the backslash character (\) must now be escaped as \092.<br><br>You may also encode special characters in a hexadecimal format rather than a decimal format.  In this case, the escape sequence consists of the "\" character followed by either an upper or lower case "x" followed by two upper or lower case hexadecimal digits.  A carriage return using the hex format would be \x0D.  You must also include a 2 in the flags sum as is the case with decimal escape codes.
