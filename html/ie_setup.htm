      This step is required with a new PLC or anytime the PLC is reset. It may
      also be occasionally necessary if the PLC is not acting normally.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Clear</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Clears all ID's from the PLC internal database. Usually a good idea to
      perform this step prior to adding PowerHome Insteon device ID's to PLC.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Add Min</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Add's PowerHome Device ID's to the PLC internal database in a minimal
      format. This is the default method and will add the minimum amount of
      information in order for PowerHome to function properly. If it is desired
      for the PLC to have fully constructed link information, then use the "Add
      Full" option instead.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      If the PLC is new or has been reset, this is a required step in order for
      PowerHome to function properly. Also may be required if Insteon Devices
      have been manually added to PowerHome. Usually best to Clear PLC Database
      prior to executing this function.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Add Full</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Add's PowerHome Device ID's to the PLC internal database in full linked
      format. Use this method if the PLC will have custom code or be connected
      to an application that requires the PLC to have fully formed link
      information. It is not necessary to use this option if the PLC will be
      used only with PowerHome.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Use the "Clear" option to clear current PLC device ID's before adding new
      device ID's.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Links</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Clears stored Insteon Device link information from PowerHome database.
      Does NOT affect actual link data stored within Insteon devices. Useful
      when you want to have PowerHome rediscover link information from Insteon
      devices.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Devices</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Clears stored Insteon Device data from PowerHome database. Use with
      caution. You will either have to manually re-enter or Auto Discover
      Insteon devices in order for PowerHome to work properly after using this
      command.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Create</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      This option will scan the currently connected PLC for stored Device ID's
      (Insteon Addresses). Any ID's not found in the PowerHome Insteon Devices
      table will be queued for Pinging. Pinged devices that respond properly
      will then be automatically added to the PowerHome Insteon Devices table
      with a default ID in the form of "NEW SPIDER ??" where ?? is a sequential
      unique number.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      This option is useful for quickly getting Insteon Devices into PowerHome
      if the PLC has already been configured to recognize them.</div>
    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">Auto Discovery</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Places PowerHome and the PLC into Auto Discovery mode. This will allow you
      to register Insteon devices within PowerHome without having to manually
      key in their unique address. Especially useful if switches are already
      installed and you don't wish to remove the faceplate to read the address.
      Once Auto Discovery is turned on, you must visit every Insteon device and
      place it in linking mode by pressing the set button for 3 seconds or the
      On button for 10 seconds. As soon as the device enters link mode, you will
      hear the WAV file and/or TTS confirmation if you've enabled those options.
      Once link mode has been entered and confirmation received, press the On
      button briefly to exit link mode. Make a list of the order in which you
      visit the switches. When done, return to PowerHome and turn off Auto
      Discovery mode. Your Insteon devices will have been automatically entered
      into the PowerHome database for you with an ID that begins with "NEW
      DEVICE XX" where XX will be a number in the order that the devices were
      discovered (hence the need to make a list). You will want to rename the ID
      and Description appropriately.</div>
