      pointing to the phcid.ini configuration file.&nbsp; The phcid.ini file
      will need to be edited to set the proper configuration.&nbsp; The first
      section to configure is the [config] section.&nbsp; Set the "port" value
      to the COM port your CID modem is listening to.&nbsp; The default settings
      of "9600,N,8,1" should be fine for most modems.&nbsp; There will be
      several "CIDInit" parameters with all but one commented out (preceeded
      with a semicolon).&nbsp; Select the CID Initialization parameter for your
      modem and make sure it is the only uncommented one.&nbsp; For a caller ID
      modem, set the "format" to 1.&nbsp; For a NetCallerID box, set the
      "format" to 2.&nbsp; "Lookupnames" can be set to 1 to have CID supplied
      names substituted with names of your choosing as defined in the [Names]
      section.&nbsp; A value of 0 will use CID supplied names.&nbsp; The
      [HangUp] section can be configured to optionally automatically hang up on
      user defined numbers. </div>

      This plugin provides Caller ID support within PowerHome.&nbsp; With a
      properly configured Caller ID modem or NetCallerID box, PowerHome will
      fire triggers when the phone rings based upon caller ID information.&nbsp;
      When a call comes in, the plugin will fire a generic plugin trigger on
      command 1, option 1 for all calls.&nbsp; The CID number will be in [TEMP5]
      and the CID name will be in [TEMP10].&nbsp; If you have configured the CID
      plugin to hang up on certain numbers, calls that are hung up on will ALSO
      fire a generic plugin trigger on command 1, option 2.&nbsp; The same
      information will be available in the [TEMP] variables.&nbsp; In addition
      to the triggers, the plugin also provides support for directly
      communicating with the modem via the ph_picmd function.&nbsp; Command 1
      and 2 are available in the CID plugin.&nbsp; Command 1 will send the
      string in data3 direct to the modem. This string can contain binary
      characters by escaping them with the "\" character followed by 3 digits
      for a decimal representation of the ASCII code or followed by an "x" and 2
      digits for a hexadecimal representation of the ASCII code. Command 2 will
      send the string in data3 to the modem with no interpretation and will
      automatically embed a carriage return at the end.</div>
