    <div class="topic indent3 padtop1">How PowerHome uses Insteon:</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      PowerHome supports both direct commands from the PLC to another Insteon
      device as well as group commands sent from the PLC. PowerHome should also
      accurately track all Insteon commands whether they originate from
      PowerHome or from any other Insteon device on the network and update the
      Device Status screen appropriately.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      PowerHome also supports the creation of links within the PLC and remote
      devices from within PowerHome. If you prefer to create links using the
      physical tap-tap method, PowerHome supports this as well and will
      automatically query remote devices for any changes within their database.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      To set PowerHome up for Insteon use, you must first declare an Insteon
      controller in the PowerHome Explorer. Open the PowerHome Explorer and
      using the left-hand tree view, navigate to
      PowerHome-&gt;Setup-&gt;Controllers. Assign a short, meaningful ID (you
      will use this ID to send Insteon commands) and choose either the "Insteon
      DM" controller type if you have a PLC or the "Insteon PLM" if you have a
      PLM. Click the "Active" box. You can click the "Settings" button to see
      the individual settings, but the defaults should be fine. Restart or
      Reinitialize (Files-&gt;Reinitialize) PowerHome in order for the changes
      to take effect and allow the Insteon Controller to load.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Once PowerHome is restarted, the SmartHome Insteon Device Manager should
      automatically load if selected "Insteon DM".&nbsp; PLM users can ignore
      the comments concerning the SDM.&nbsp; You should see a new icon in the
      System Tray (the list of icons on the far right of the Start toolbar). The
      Device Manager should automatically detect the type of PLC and what port
      it is on but sometimes fails to do so. If the Device Manager is unable to
      sense your PLC, PowerHome will respond with the message: "The XXX PLC is
      not responding. Commands will not be sent." where XXX is the ID you
      assigned to your Insteon controller. If you should get this message, open
      the SmartHome Device Manager by doubleclicking it's icon in the System
      Tray. You should see the SmartHome Device Manager window open. Left click
      anywhere in the big log window and then type the letters D M. A single
      line edit window should open towards the bottom of the screen. Type
      "port=?" without the quotes in the edit window and press enter. This
      should force the DM to locate your PLC. Give it a few seconds and you
      should see "PLC: port=true" in the log window. However, if it still cannot
      locate your PLC, you may get a "PLC: port=false" message. Whatever message
      you get, type "getport" in the edit window and press enter. In the log
      window, you should see what port the DM is currently looking at. If you
      have a USB PLC, then the port should be "USB4". If your PLC is serial,
      then you should see COM followed by the number of the COM port the PLC is
      in. If the port returned by getport is not correct for your setup then
      type "port=USB4" if your PLC is USB and "port=COM1" if your PLC is serial
      and connected to COM1. Adjust the COM port number for your situation. You
      can verify the port was set using the "getport" command. Once the DM
      finally recognizes your PLC, it will store the settings in the registry
      and will be remembered unless you change the port. Once everything is
      communicating, you can minimize the DM.</div>
    <div class="indent4 padtop1">
      Once a controller has been created and communications established with the
      Insteon Device Manager, you're ready to setup your Insteon network. The
      easiest way to do this is to use the Insteon Explorer. This new window is
      totally dedicated to setting and maintaining your Insteon network. You can
      read about this screen in the next section.</div>
