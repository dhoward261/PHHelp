Formulas

</div>

<p>Formulas are where most of your automation power is derived.  Formulas are used within macros on several functions, within triggers, within PSP (PowerHome Server Pages) and all Send Keys are a formula whose result is sent to the Send Keys interpreter.  Formulas can return text, numeric, and date/time values.  Before a formula is evaluated, variable substitution is performed upon it.  Once variable substitution is complete, the formula is passed to the formula evaluator.  The results of the formula are then passed back.  Formulas themselves can contain a number of functions.  You can find a list of these formula functions under Formulas -> Functions.</p>
