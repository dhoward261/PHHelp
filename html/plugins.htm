    <div class="ph1"> Plugins </div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">PowerHome has support for externally developed modules
      called plugins.&nbsp; These plugins extend standard PowerHome
      functionality by providing features that are not a part of the core
      PowerHome set.&nbsp; Some plugins were automatically installed when
      PowerHome was installed and may be declared and configured within this
      screen.&nbsp; For further information on plugins in general, see the
      plugins section within this document.</div>
    <div class="indent2 padtop1">The Setup Plugins screen is similar to 
the Setup Controllers screen in that a “Load Order” column exists.&nbsp; Like 
controllers, plugins will be loaded sequentially in the order specified by this 
column.&nbsp; Plugins also require a unique (within this screen) ID.&nbsp; 
Plugin Type (at this time) will always be “ActiveX” and cannot be changed.&nbsp; 
The “Launch Data” field requires you to type in the class identifier for plugin 
activex control.&nbsp; You can find a list of these identifiers for the included 
plugins installed with PowerHome in the Plugins section of this manual.&nbsp; 
The next column is the “Initialization Data” field and will contain any 
initialization data required to setup the plugin.&nbsp; Since this is a single 
column and some plugins require more than a single value for init data, this 
field is commonly used to point to an INI file for the plugin for all of its 
configuration settings.&nbsp; However, whatever value is required here will be 
determined by the plugin itself and the documentation accompanying the plugin 
should detail what is required in this field.&nbsp; The last field is the 
“Active” field and if checked, will cause the plugin to be loaded whenever 
PowerHome is started or reinitialized. </div>
