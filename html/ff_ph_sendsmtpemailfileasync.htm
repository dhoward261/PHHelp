  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>type</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>Integer. The type of PowerHome action 
      you'd like executed when the email is sent. Use 0 to not trigger any 
      action. Use 1 to trigger a macro. Use 2 to execute a named formula ID. Use 
      3 to execute a raw formula. This parameter goes hand in hand with the id 
      parameter.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>id</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>String. Data for the triggered action. 
      If type is 0, then set this parameter to an empty string. If type is 1, 
      then set ID to a valid macro ID. If type is 2, then set ID to a valid 
      formula ID. If type is 3, then ID should contain a valid raw formula you'd 
      like to be executed.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>server</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>String. The IP or URL of the SMTP 
      server.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>port</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>Long. The port for the SMTP server. 
      Typically, this will be 25.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>from</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>String. An email address for who the 
      mail is from. If your SMTP server requires authentication then this field 
      will also contain the userid and password. See usage below for more 
    detail.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>to</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>String. The email address to send the 
      email to. If you're sending to multiple recipients, then separate the 
      email addresses with a comma. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD class=ph8>subject</TD>
    <TD class=ph9>String. The subject of the email.

<td class=ph9 >
 String. The full path and filename of 
      the file attachment you'd like to send. Separate multiple attachments with 
      a vertical bar character "|". Don't use spaces.</td>

<div class=ph10>Return value</div>
<div class=ph11>
Integer. This function will return a 0.

<div class=ph12>

   Usage

</div>

<div class=ph13>Use this function to send email with 
attachments via SMTP asynchronously. Email will be sent in the background and 
PowerHome will operate without hanging for the email to complete. If you'd like 
to trigger an action once the email is sent, set the type and id parameters 
appropriately.

<BR >

<BR >If you trigger a 
process (type = 1, 2, 3) when the email is sent, then your macro or formula will 
have access to the results of the SMTP email send operation. Three return values 
are available. Use ph_getmtret to retrieve the results of the send process. If 
successful, this value will be 0. If a failure occured, this value will be a 
positive number from 1 to 9 indicating at what step in the send process the 
failure occured. Use ph_getlasterror to retrieve a numeric value indicating what 
the specific error was. This value will be 0 if there is no failure, otherwise 
non-zero if a failure occured. Use ph_getlasterrorstring to retrieve a string 
representation of what step in the send process a failure occured. If email 
transmission was successful, then this string will indicate success.&nbsp;

<BR >

<BR>
If your SMTP server requires 
authentication, then embed the credentials in the from parameter. The from 
parameter should first contain the from email address followed by a comma (don't 
use any spaces) followed by the SMTP userid followed by a comma followed by the 
SMTP password.</div>
